_Urgent_:

_General_:
- add a `--force` option to `link_dotfiles.sh`
- add an option to choose Core, minimal or full package install
- backup the following configs :
    - qutebrowser
- find a mail client probably.

_Individual config files_:
- XMonad
    - Clickable workspaces in xmobar with `XMonad.*.ServerMode` and xmobar
      actions
    - Custom LogHook to synthesise the state of all screens (urgent, which one
      is active, etc.)
    - InsertPositions. Do we give focus to new windows ?
