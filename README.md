This repo has a backup of my config files.

Use the `link_dotfiles.sh` script to link the real config files to the ones in
this repo.

The vim config is hosted on a separate repo, included as a submodule in this directory. Use the following commands in the cloned repo to fetch it :

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
